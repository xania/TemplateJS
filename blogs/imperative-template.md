## Imperative Template Framework

Why is React JS the most popular framework today? This article is a good template framework 

Back in 2013/2014 When JavaScript was finally fully accepted as an essential part of the web, basically at this time you could get yourself arrested if you turn off javascript on your browser. For a client in the Netherlands I thought I could easily switch to writing fully web based applications, but I ended up with 2 years of frustration because of the challenges that arise when working with tools like jQuery, KnockoutJS and even KendoJS. 

Even since I've had been looking for a better framework for the web and for a moment I though I had found one named DurandalJS but this one was based on KnockoutJS which itself had some serious drawbacks. 

Finally, when React JS arrived and brought some radical ideas like JSX and dismissing the separation of technology by that, the best lesson for me was that I had to trust my intuition again even if it was radical.
